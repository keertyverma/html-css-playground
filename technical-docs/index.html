          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
              (WWW).
            </li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>
              Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
              one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

          <p>
            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
            write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          </p>
          <code>
            <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</p>
            <p>greetMe("World");</p>
          </code>
          <p>
            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
            browser!

        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
          <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
          <code> var x = 42. </code>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
          <code>x = 42.</code>
          <p>
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
            JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
          </p>
          <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
          <code>let y = 13.</code>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
        <header>
          <h1>Variable scope</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.
          </p>
          <code>
            <p>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p>
          </code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>
          <code>
            <p>
              if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            </p>
            <p>not defined</p>
          </code>
